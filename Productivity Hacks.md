## Productivity Hacks

These ideas obviously doesn't just apply to coding. So why record it on GitHub? Well, it's because reading them when you're 'stuck' can help with reaffirmation of those ideas, and a renewal of spirit, in a nice central place that's a bit more work related than something like social media. I'm making an argument that just by reading productivity hacks, one becomes more productive. You are what you read.

### View the Day In Quarters

It can be tempting to treat an unproductive morning as a write-off day. Put simply, it feels bad to have not achieved your goal, regardless of whether this is because you spent the time procrastinating, or because whatever you were doing, just didn't work.

View the day in quarters - you've got early morning (before 10:00), late morning (after 10:00 but before lunch), early afternoon (after lunch through to about 3:30), and late afternoon (after 3:30). You can even introduce early/late evening, if you're so inclined.

By doing this, you're openly admitting that ok, those last few hours didn't go to plan, but you can get back on it right now with the start of a new quarter-day. Keep going and good luck!

### Productive Procrastination

This is one of my favourite ideas. Procrastination is natural, so harness it's power. If you've got a task that you know you procrastinate from (for me, it might be packing my bag), use that as motivation to force yourself to do another task that you procrastinate from (let's say, cleaning the shower that you've been putting off for a while).

Ok, so I'm not saying ignore packing forever, but the killer part of procrastination is where we replace packing with time-waster activities like sitting on our phone. If you're going to procrastinate, it's more productive to not fight it, and get something productive done instead.

I find this is especially motiviational when one task has a deadline. You know you WILL have to do that task sooner or later, so leave it to last and get everything else done first. If all you attempt is packing, then that shower (which has no deadline) is probably still not going to get cleaned.

### Know When to Throw the Towel In

Sometimes, it just isn't going to happen. No matter how much you try, you're just not making progress, for whatever reason. When this happens, take a break. I don't mean just looking at your phone. I mean a proper break. Get up, change your environment, go for a walk. Do something fun. It's a little bit like 'work hard, play hard'.

I have seen others who feel duty bound to remain at their desk, even though they're no longer productive. They'll be doing anything else, but they still haven't moved. They need to listen to their brain and give it the proper break that it needs. What would you rather do, achieve an hour of work that day whilst being sat in front of a computer all day, or take a walk, and then when you get back, nice and refreshed, achieve loads more work in a smaller amount of time?

You've got to pay attention to your brain. Sometimes it just needs a rest, and that's fine.
