## 4 Questions to Ask (and Answer) when Reviewing Code

I was thinking about a discussion with my team around how to get the most out of reviewing a Pull Request.

I think I've narrowed it down to 4 questions I personally need to answer yes to in order to click 'approve':

1) What is the change trying to achieve, and do I understand how it achieves this?
2) How do I know the change works and isn't going to break anything?
3) If there is a problem with the change, do I know enough about the change to know how to fix it?
4) Would I have written this code myself (design, nomenclature, style)?

The last one in particular should be approached as a learning experience. If I ask why someone has done something, it's not because I think they're wrong. Code reviews (both as the reviewer, and the reviewee) are where I've learnt most about code and have picked up tips from others.

I personally see myself as 100% responsible for the code I review, as responsible as the person who wrote the code. This helps ease the burden on the person who wrote the code, which I don't think is possible without being able to answer 4 honest Yes's to the above questions.
