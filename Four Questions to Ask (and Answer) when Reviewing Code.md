## 4 Questions to Ask (and Answer) when Reviewing Code

What do you think about when you are reviewing code?

As an Agile team, we had identified that our code reviews weren’t consistent across the team. Expectations of what to expect in a code review, and what we should get out of the code review differed. This led to an open discussion about what we should be thinking about when reviewing code.

I always advocate Agile team members discussing the development process that they use. Open discussion leads to learning opportunities and helps ensure the Agile principle: people over processes. If code reviews are never discussed amongst team members, the whole team will miss out on a massive learning opportunity. Worse still, the review itself may be ineffectual. 

We went back-to-basics and came up with 4 questions that we’d aim to answer before clicking ‘approve’ for a piece of code.

1) What is the change trying to achieve, and do I understand how it achieves this?
2) How do I know the change works and isn't going to break anything?
3) If there is a problem with the change, do I know enough about the change to know how to fix it?
4) Would I have written this code myself (design, nomenclature, style)?

The last one in particular should be approached as a learning experience. If I ask why someone has done something, it's not because I think they're wrong. Code reviews (both as the reviewer, and the reviewee) are where I've learnt most about code and have picked up tips from others.

I personally see myself as 100% responsible for the code I review, as responsible as the person who wrote the code. This helps ease the burden on the person who wrote the code, which I don't think is possible without being able to answer 4 honest Yes's to the above questions.
