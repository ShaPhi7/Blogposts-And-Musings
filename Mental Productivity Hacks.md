## Mental Productivity Hacks

These ideas obviously doesn't just apply to coding. So why record it on GitHub? Well, it's because reading them when you're 'stuck' can help with reaffirmation of those ideas, and a renewal of spirit, in a nice central place that's a bit more work related than something like social media (I'll use social media as a reference through these ideas, as I believe it's the most common distraction, but really, these ideas apply to any distraction).

I'm making an argument that just by reading productivity hacks, one becomes more productive. You are what you read.

### View the Day In Quarters

It can be tempting to treat an unproductive morning as a write-off day. Put simply, it feels bad to have not achieved your goal, regardless of whether this is because you spent the time procrastinating, or because whatever you were doing, just didn't work.

View the day in quarters - you've got early morning (before 10:00), late morning (after 10:00 but before lunch), early afternoon (after lunch through to about 3:30), and late afternoon (after 3:30). You can even introduce early/late evening, if you're so inclined.

By doing this, you're openly admitting that ok, those last few hours didn't go to plan, but you can get back on it right now with the start of a new quarter-day. Keep going and good luck!

### Productive Procrastination

This is one of my favourite ideas. Procrastination is natural, so harness it's power. If you've got a task that you know you procrastinate from (for me, it might be packing my bag), use that as motivation to force yourself to do another task that you procrastinate from (let's say, cleaning the shower that you've been putting off for a while).

Ok, so I'm not saying ignore packing forever, but the killer part of procrastination is where we replace packing with time-waster activities like sitting on our phone. If you're going to procrastinate, it's more productive to not fight it, and get something productive done instead.

I find this is especially motiviational when one task has a deadline. You know you WILL have to do that task sooner or later, so leave it to last and get everything else done first. If all you attempt is packing, then that shower (which has no deadline) is probably still not going to get cleaned.

### Know When to Throw the Towel In

Sometimes, it just isn't going to happen. No matter how much you try, you're just not making progress, for whatever reason. When this happens, take a break. I don't mean just looking at your phone. I mean a proper break. Get up, change your environment, go for a walk. Do something fun. It's a little bit like 'work hard, play hard'.

I have seen others who feel duty bound to remain at their desk, even though they're no longer productive. They'll be doing anything else, but they still haven't moved. They need to listen to their brain and give it the proper break that it needs. What would you rather do, achieve an hour of work that day whilst being sat in front of a computer all day, or take a walk, and then when you get back, nice and refreshed, achieve loads more work in a smaller amount of time?

You've got to pay attention to your brain. Sometimes it just needs a rest, and that's fine.

### Dopamine Time Delays

Dopamine is a chemical that our brains release to tell us to keep doing something. Addictive sources, like social media, cause our brains to release dopamine, making us wanting to do more of the same.

So to become more productive, we need to break the connection between wanting a distraction, and the reward of getting that distraction (i.e. the release of dopamine).

One way to achieve this is when you feel that urge to check social media, set a timer before you may access it. This delay in response will help to break the connection. You can take this further by increasing the time delay by a minute each time. After the 5th check, you're waiting on a 5 minute timer. Hopefully, during this 5 minutes, you can be even more productive than normal. For me, I reset the timer back down to zero at the start of each new day.

Moreover, you're going to want to be super-focussed because you know that in a few minutes, you'll be procrastinating. Over time, you'll find that the urge passes, and you power on through without even needing to look at the phone. You're getting your dopamine release from completing yout task, not from social media.

There is also a side-game to play, to see how low you can keep the timer throughout the day. If you felt urges 10 times yesterday, ramping the timer up to 10 minutes, see if you can keep the timer below 9 minutes today.

### Write Down Your Accomplishments

Keep a diary, make a list, create a mindmap. Just find some way to keep track of what you've done. This helps keep you accountable to yourself. Sometimes we just need to visually see whether we need to put more effort into something.

I did this when writing my 50+ page thesis. I jotted down the current total number of pages each day into a diary I was keeping at the time, this gave me the drive to get that extra page in. If I didn't, it looked like I'd done less work that day. It kept me driven.

Simiarly, when working on a project that I was struggling to make time for, I started a big board of all of my achievements, that could add to at the end of that day. If I went a few days at a time without working on it, then it became painfully obvious that I wasn't making time for it. 

Of course, there are a couple of risks. This approach could add unwanted pressure, so use in coordination with other ideas, like knowing when to throw the towel in. Know yourself. There's also the risk that we end up working towards our recorded goal, rather than end result. For example, by recording my pages for my thesis, I was promoting quantity over quality. For me, this was ok, as the bit I'd found hardest was just to get something down on paper. Once it was there, refining it was easier. It all comes back to being honest with yourself, and treating yourself well. Happiness away from work will always shine through to your work.

### Bribe Yourself

I wasn't sure whether to include this one but I will, as it's a very basic idea that does work. If it works for you, then who is anyone else to judge?

Want to eat that chocolate bar, or some other treat? Promise yourself that you're only going to eat it, once you are sat down and working! Sounds silly, sounds childish, but it works. You'll have got over that initial procrastination in no time, and be happily working and chomping away.

More generally, treat yourself when you've done well. Please feel no guilt about giving yourself a reward if you've done really well that day. Give your brain a reason to release dopamine when you've done well at tasks, and it'll be easier to achieve success on those same tasks next time.
